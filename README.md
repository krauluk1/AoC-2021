# Advent of Code 2021

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021) is an online advent calendar offering a series of Christmas programming challenges from 1 to 25 December. The puzzles cover a variety of skills and difficulty levels and can be solved using any programming language. The daily challenges consist of two parts that need to be solved in the correct order. This repository includes my solutions for Advent of Code 2021 (see https://adventofcode.com/2021 for the details).
